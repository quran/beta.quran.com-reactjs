# Quran.com

This is the project soon to be the Quran.com facing site. This is built in
[Reactjs] + [Redux] + [Expressjs] + [Webpack]. It is isomorphic (javascript shared
between both the server and the client) for SEO reasons.

## How to contribute

## Server-Side Integration
Unless you have the backend API running locally, you will need to update the `API_URL`, in `development.env` file, from `localhost` to `api.quran.com`. Leave the port number same.

To start the app, run `npm run dev` which will run both the server and the client (webpack) to compile upon edits. Go to http://localhost:8001 in your browser, not 8000 (that is just the express server).


## Backend
Current at: https://github.com/quran/quran-api-rails
DB is private, message me for access.


## Design
We currently use InvisionApp. Again, contact me if you'd like access to it.

## Making sure main.js is small
Follow: https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-bundle-size-analyzer
```
env NODE_ENV=development webpack --json > bundle-stats.json
subl bundle-stats.json #so that you can the output
analyze-bundle-size bundle-stats.json
```
