To whom it may concern. These are quick surah intros from 
Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi - Tafhim al-Qur'an - The Meaning of the Qur'an,
sourced from englishtafsir.com.

In the future we'll probably want to enhance these and make them
editable/improvable via wiki suggestion or something (if we have a
scholar as an editor), or normalize them and attribute them by
language, source and author in the database so we can i18n the 
offering of surah intros to other languages.

For the time being it's probably sufficient to go through them
by hand and change the ayah and ayah range references to internal
hyperlinks.
