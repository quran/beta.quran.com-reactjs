            The Noble Quran is the central
            religious text of Islam. Muslims believe the Qurâ€™an is the
            book of Divine guidance and direction for mankind, and
            consider the original Arabic text the final revelation of
            Allah (God).[<a href="en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quran">1</a>]
            All translations of the original Arabic text
            are thus interpretations of the original meanings and should
            be embraced as such. For more information about the Noble
            Quran, you may visit its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quran">Wikipedia article.</a>

          <h4 className="source-sans">
            The Meccan suras are the chronologically earlier chapters
            (suras) of the Quran that were, according to Islamic
            tradition, revealed anytime before the migration of the
            Islamic prophet Muhammed and his followers from Mecca to
            Medina (Hijra). The Medinan suras are those revelations that
            occurred after the move to the city of that name.

            The Medinan suras or Medinan chapters of the Quran are the
            latest 24 suras that, according to Islamic tradition, were
            revealed at Medina after Muhammad&apos;s hijra from Mecca. These
            suras were revealed by Allah when the Muslim community was
            larger and more developed, as opposed to their minority position
            in Mecca.
