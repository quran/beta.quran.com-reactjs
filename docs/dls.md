# DLS

Since the inception of this project, we relied heavily on Bootstrap to get started quickly and to standardize our code. Unfortunately, Bootstrap provides much more than we need, and `react-bootstrap` was not as flexible as we'd like. Additionally, we began to create our own styles and components that did not exist in Bootstrap.

This is the purpose of the dls directory inside of `/src/components`. In an effort to standardize how we create commonly shared components, these components will live inside of DLS and serve as components for the whole application. In the future, this repo may expand beyond Quran.com frontend (perhaps other apps, websites, projects, etc.). DLS will serve these apps. 

Lastly, designers can now create common components they would like to be used across our app.
