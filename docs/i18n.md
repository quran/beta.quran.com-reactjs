Part of servicing our community is having the ability to welcome visitors from all languages. Currently, Quran.com supports a number of translations and a few language locales.

Locale translations are inside of `/src/locale`. 

### Adding a new key
Simply add a new key inside of `keys.ts` and add that key to the locales you wish to edit. Ideally, we have a script that will add it to all the translations.

### Viewing missing translations
TODO: add a page that will show the missing translations for all the keys we have

### `T` component
This component shall serve to translate all our text. Please use it and avoid wrapping a component with `react-intl`'s HOC. 

### Client side
To access locale data on the client, our bundle sizes began to increase due to requiring each locale file (we'd build all the different locale files into the client bundle!). Instead, the server will send this data on first render and can be picked up once the client code loads. See `/config/components/ClientConfig.tsx` for more information on how this data arrives to client.
