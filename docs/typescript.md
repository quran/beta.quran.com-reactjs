# Typescript

In an effort to standardize our code and make it as bug free as possible while welcoming contributors with different experiences and skill level, we believe Typescript will assist us in our goals. Typescript is static safe, and intergrates well with editors such as VS Code, offering autocompletes and lints right in editors.

### Shapes
In addition to React PropTypes, we created shapes to correspond with those PropTypes. Find them in `/src/shapes`. Please keep these organized as much as possible.

### $TsFixMe
This is a created type in `global.d.ts`. It's a hack and strong advise not to use it.
